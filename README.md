# OwO

a guide for scripts on (mainly) mta dm mapping
_______________________________________________________
import scripts into main.lua >>>> "-- add scripts here"


I highly recommend using code editors such as Visual Studio Code or Atom to edit lua files
They change the color of code to make it easy to recognize where things are and the difference between code & comment
